Melany for Wordpress
====================

Melany is a simple, minimal and responsive WordPress Theme aimed at bringing a pure Twitter Bootstrap experience in WordPress blogs.
It is addressed to privates and small businesses that need to focus users attention in the content, but allows deep customizations.

Limitations
-----------

This theme supports only 2 menu levels.
Bootstrap 3 comes with support for only 2 menu levels (that is, one visible and one dropdown level).
As Melany aims at giving a pure Bootstrap experience, the dropdown levels are not extended.
